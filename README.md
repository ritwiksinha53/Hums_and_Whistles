Both parts of the project are divided into 9 bullets. All of them are as follows:

## 1. Author Name - It contains my name as problem statements and code for both basic and advanced parts are driven by me.
## 2. Problem formulation - It describes the problem statement.
## 3. Machine Learning Pipeline - It describes complete ML pipeline, identifying input, output, intermediate steps i.e., from transformation to models, and intermediate data moving from one stage to the next.
## 4. Transformation stage - It describes any transformations done, such as feature extraction.
## 5. Modelling - It describes different Machine Learning models implemented for each of the parts of the project.
## 6. Methodology - It describes assessment of model performance on the basis of different evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, correlation plots etc.
## 7. Dataset - It descibes the specific data used and any visualisation that will be done during experimentations.
## 8. Results - It contains the coding part, having every step necessary for building a model and making predictions.
## 9. Conclusion - It describes the conclusions obtained and any possible improvements.
